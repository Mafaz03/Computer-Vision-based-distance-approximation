# Computer-Vision-based-distance-approximation

An Alternative approach to lidar in the realm of distance approximation focusing on autonomousity.

This repository introduces an innovative approach to accurate distance approximation using a single 
monocular camera and deep learning models. By leveraging the Midas depth estimation framework and 
rule-based reasoning, the proposed method eliminates the need for expensive sensors like Lidar, Lasers, and Radar, 
thereby reducing costs and system complexity in autonomous systems.


Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed approach in various real-world scenarios. By
bypassing the need for traditional expensive, the mono camera
rule-based distance approximation offers a cost-effective and
efficient solution for depth perception in autonomous systems.
This has implications for industries such as robotics, self-driving
vehicles, and smart surveillance systems, enabling the
development of more accessible and practical autonomous
platforms.
